Designing for Junto 
============

Junto Studio marks include, but are not limited to, the Junto Studio name, "Pear Ship" logo and any word, phrase, image, or other designation that identifies the source of any of Junto Studio’s products.

Don't modify the marks or use them in a confusing way, including suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Junto Studio, or in a way that confuses Junto Studio with another studio or brand.

#### Fun

The Junto brand is friendly and empathic. It's meant to communicate the joy of learning, accessible to anyone.

#### Simple & Smart

We achive simplicity by **reducing and substracting**. Before putting somehting out in the wild, we boil it down so it's easy to understand and use. Our website encaptures this practice.

Check our [Design Principles] (https://github.com/thejunto/design/blob/master/what's-design.md) to have a better grasp on the set of forces behind the main website's design.

Here are other guides you should have in mind when contribuiting:  

1. **Centered Grid**    
   Emphasis in the center. Make the experience fluid and guided.
  
1. **White Space**    
   Graphic elements mantain a safety space that equals 200% the size of the square around it.

1. **Clear Copy**    
   Follow these guides when writing copy:
  - Stick to one idea.
  - Make your idea tangible. Stick to one reference or term.
  - Say *what it is instead* of *what it is not*.
  - Use concrete nouns.
  - Make one clause sentences.
  - Don't be self-referential. 
  - No clichés.
  - No nominalization.
  - No passive voice.
  - No gerunds.
  
1. **Sans Serif Typefaces**    
   Avoid distracting the reader with cumbersome typefaces. Some recurrent examples are:

The Logo

Our logo is always either full-colored or white. The Pear Ship is never shown in black or other colors.
