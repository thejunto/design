Designing for Junto 
============

Junto Studio marks include, but are not limited to, the Junto Studio name, "Pear Ship" logo and any word, phrase, image, or other designation that identifies the source or origin of any of Junto Studioâ€™s products.

Do not modify or alter the marks or use them in a confusing way, including suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Junto Studio, or in a way that confuses Junto Studio with another studio or brand.
