What is Design for Us?
============

Form follows function
---------------

Our main goal is to communicate in the most efficient way possible. No clutter, only simple and clear statements. Style is a derivative that enhances, not saturates. 

A collaborative process
---------------

More feedback equals stronger websites. We build on top of everyone’s ideas and we craft every website under the principle of communication.

Testing and measuring
---------------

Design attracts uncertainty, but we fight it. We objectivize design by measuring it. It’s a process of trial and error that guides us towards solid and trusty prototypes that relate to users.

A fast learning experience
---------------

Learning fast allows us to understand, with minimum use of resources, the best way we can hit the mark.
