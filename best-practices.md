Best Practices
============


We create Smart Sites. Please, take the time to read this [Guide to Create Smart Sites](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/news-events/impress-smart-site).

User Interface
---------------

We evaluate our websites on the following criteria:

1. Is the websiteâ€™s goal easily attainable and desirable?
1. Is the website simple, easy to comprehend and intuitive? 
1. Is the flow through the site obvious?
1. Do elements relate smartly to each other? 
1. Is the website congruent and consistent as a whole?

Interaction Design
---------------

Manipulation of the website makes it come to life. We use these interactions for helping a user understand the interface. They help guide a user from the beginning of a task through it's completion. These are any sort of animations or effects.

Visual Design
---------------

Visual design is the style. We use the [universal design principles](https://upcase.com/design-for-developers-resources/principles?__hstc=28062627.771b37efac40599ec33e88d12b25eeb5.1424830187104.1424830187104.1426308747136.2&__hssc=28062627.1.1426308747136&__hsfp=499586661) to communicate and bring order. Those fundamentals are:

1. Alignment 
1. Emphasis
1. Hierarchy 
1. Consistency 
1. White Space 
1. Balance
1. Unity

User Interviews & Testing
---------------

We test a product viability and usability by running user interviews. Having a testing plan early is the best way to consistently run the interviews. Generally, it would happen the fifth day of the Sprint. This is your checklist:

1. On the first day of the sprint (Understanding phase), ask the client to schedule 4 interviewees for the fifth or sixth day of the sprint.

1. Check the following to days that the interviewees have been scheduled. Ask your client for their email addresses.

1. One day before the interviews, email the interviewees the following template and confirm attendance.
	
  > Hello Testers!
  
  > I'm ***Name***, in-house designer at Junto Studio. 
    Today, I'll be running the user interviews for a mockup version of the ***Name*** website.
    Please, add Junto Studio to your contact list in Skype.

  > I'll meet you all at your respective time:
  
  > ***Clear Schedule***
  
  > Thank you for joining us in this ride!
  
1. On the day of the interviews, follow this guide: [The product design sprint: Validate](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-validateday5)

1. After the session, we look at our notes to identify the top problems and we fix them when building the final version.

Building & Asseting
---------------

1. A full screen layout is 1366 px x 768 px. Keep this in mind when creating the main layout of any final version in Photoshop.

1. When assets are already created, save them in a file with the project's name and upload it to Junto's shared Dropbox.
