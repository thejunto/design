Designing in a Junto Sprint
============

Hand-made Mockup
---------------

We sketch interfaces before implementing them. Sketching allows to get a physical, instantaneous grasp of an idea. It’s an intuitive process without rules. 

Everyone involved in a Junto Sprint is encouraged to sketch in the making-prototypes phase. Please, ask for a Junto Notebook if you’re eager to start.

Digital Wireframes for Invision
---------------

The team must understand the core experience of the website as fast as possible. With the designer’s help, everyone builds digital wireframes of their hand-made sketches using latest versions of Sketch, Keynote or Squarespace templates. 

Focus is placed on wireframing usability, user experience, and flows (check Best Practices section). Then, the designer uploads the everyone’s wireframes to Invision.

Cutting or changing features will happen along the iterative phases of voting and interviewing. Remember it’s wasteful to spend time wireframing features that never get built.

Final Version
---------------

With the feedback received in the interviews, the designer will refine one digital version. This is built using latest versions of Photoshop or Sketch. Now, the designer pays careful attention to detail. This is the guide that the developer will use to code the official website.
